# Digital Obsidian Garden
---

As a research group our mutual goal had been to increase our knowledge of intercultural theories and international thinkers.
Thus, each of us did their best to write a relatively short conclusion of one chapter from the book "Kultur. Theorien der Gegenwart" (2011) by Moebius and Quadflieg.

In order of merging all that information we worked together in Obsidian Vaults (https://obsidian.md/). To publish such a vault there is a simple Community Plugin option which you can find at the end of this document. As publishing service we used Vercel.

Here you can find our final endresult: https://sankt-afra-ik-p.vercel.app/

This is the template to be used together with the [Digital Garden Obsidian Plugin](https://github.com/oleeskild/Obsidian-Digital-Garden). 
See the README in the plugin repo for information on how to set it up.
